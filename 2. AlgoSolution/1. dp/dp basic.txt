DP = carefull brute force
DP = memorization + recursion + guessing
DP = shortest path in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

time of DP = time of subproblem * number of subprolem


Five Easy Steps for DP from

1. Define Subproblems
2. Guess part of the solution
3. Relate Subproblem Solutions
4. Recursion & Memorization (Decide bottom-up or top-down)
5. Solve Original Problem
